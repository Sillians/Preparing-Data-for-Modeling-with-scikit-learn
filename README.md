# Preparing-Data-for-Modeling-with-scikit-learn
Data preparation often takes eighty percent of the data scientist's time in a data science project, which emphasizes its importance in the machine learning life-cycle.


Even as the number of machine learning frameworks and libraries increases on a daily basis, scikit-learn is retaining its popularity with ease. Scikit-learn makes the common use-cases in machine learning - 
1. clustering, 
2. classification, 
3. dimensionality reduction and 
3. regression - incredibly easy. 

In this Repo, Preparing Data for Modeling with scikit-learn, you will gain the ability to appropriately pre-process data, identify outliers and apply kernel approximations. 

* First, you will learn how pre-processing techniques such as standardization and scaling help improve the efficacy of ML algorithms. 
* Next, you will discover how novelty and outlier detection is implemented in scikit-learn. 
* Then, you will understand the typical set of steps needed to work with both text and image data in scikit-learn. 
* Finally, you will round out your knowledge by applying implicit and explicit kernel transformations to transform data into higher dimensions. 
This Repo will equip you with the skills and knowledge to identify the correct data pre-processing technique for your use-case and detect outliers using theoretically robust techniques.
